# Math301: Probability and Statistics
## Github for Math 301 (**Currently Under Construction**).
This Github Page contains powerpoints and other useful materials to assist students with Probability and Statistics.  See syllabus for assignments and [**more**](https://seathebass.github.io/math301/syllabus/mat301syl.html)

## Week 1
During this week, we will do a crash course in how to use R and a refresher on Integration. Do **not** worry if you have not encountered an integral before, we will cover the basics which should be all you need to understand what is happening with probability density functions and other material later on. The slides for the week will be found [**here**](https://seathebass.github.io/math301/week1pres/)

## Week 2
During this week, we will explore the beginnings of probability theory and how it can be used. This week will provide the foundations for understanding the rest of the course. The slides for the week will be found [**here**](https://seathebass.github.io/math301/presentations/week2.html)

## Week 3 and 4
During these 2 weeks, we will cover a variety of distributions associated with random variables. First, we will cover the probability mass functions, cumulative density functions and expected values of a random variable. Afterwards, we wiil explore the binomial, hypergeometric, geometric, negative binomial,and poisson distributions. The slides for these two weeks will be found [**here**](https://seathebass.github.io/math301/presentations/week3.html)

## Week 6
During this week, we will explore continuous random variables and a host of distributions which have been studied with continuous random variables. The slides can be found [**here**](https://seathebass.github.io/math301/presentations/week5.html)
