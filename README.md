## Github for Math 301.
This Github Page contains powerpoints and other useful materials to assist students with Probaility and Statistics.  See syllabus for assignents and ![**more**](https://seathebass.github.io/math301/syllabus/mat301syl.html)

## Week 1
During this week, we will do a crash course in how to use R and a refresher on Integration. Do **not** worry if you have not encountered an integral before, we will cover the basics which should be all you need to understand what is happening with probability density functions. The slides for the week will be found ![**here**](https://seathebass.github.io/math301/presentations/week1.html)

## Week 2
During this week, we will explore the beginnings of probability theory and how it can be used. This week will provide the foundations for understanding the rest of the course. The slides for the week will be found ![**here**](https://seathebass.github.io/math301/presentations/week2.html)
