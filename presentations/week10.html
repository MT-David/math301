# What we've covered so far:

- We covered z and t-tests.

- Examined different types of errors

- Examined what different hypotheses we can generate.

# Inferences based on Two Samples

Suppose `\(X_1,...,X_n\)` is a random sample from a normal population with expected value `\(\mu_1\)`, and standard deviation `\(\sigma_1\)`.
Let `\(Y_1,...,Y_n\)` be a random sample from the normal population with expected value `\(\mu_2\)` and standard deviation `\(\sigma_2\)`

- In this case we have `\(\bar{X}\bar{Y}\)` and sample standard deviations `\(S_x\)` and `\(S_y\)`. Then:

`$$Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \bar{Y}- (\mu_1-\mu_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{m} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n}}}$$`
The Z statistic in this case is useful for confidence intervals of `\(\mu_1-\mu_2\)`

The 100(1-a)% confidence interval is:
`$$\bar{X}-\bar{Y} \pm z_{a/2}\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{m}+\frac{\sigma_2^2}{m}}$$`
---
# The functions in R
- Here are the formulas translated into R as functions:
the 2 sample z-statistic

```r
z2stat &lt;- function(xbar,ybar,mu1,mu2,sigma1,sigma2,m,n){
  (xbar - ybar - (mu1-mu2))/((sigma1/m)+ (sigma2/n))
}
```

The confidence interval

```r
z2confint &lt;- function(xbar,ybar,zstar,sigma1,sigma2,m,n){
  list(lower_bound = xbar - ybar - zstar * (sqrt((sigma1/m) + (sigma2^2/n))),
       upper_bound = xbar - ybar + zstar * (sqrt((sigma1/m) + (sigma2^2/n))))
}
```

---
# Inferences based on two samples continued:
- If the `\(\sigma\)`'s are known, we can test the null that `\(\mu_1 - \mu_2 = \delta_0\)` against the alternatives.

- `\(H_a:\mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq \delta_0\)`
- `\(H_a:\mu_1 - \mu_2 \gt \delta_0\)`
- `\(H_a:\mu_1 - \mu_2 \lt \delta_0\)`

which we would reject via the z-statistic which we calculated earlier.

---
# What if we don't have sigma?
- If we don't have `\(\sigma\)`, we can use the point estimate to approximate it if our sample is large. The statistic would be calculated as follows:

`$$Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \bar{Y}- (\mu_1-\mu_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{S_1^2}{m} + \frac{S_2^2}{n}}}$$`

The above would also have the same confidence interval as the prior. All we need to do with our function is substitute `\(\sigma\)` with s.


---
# What if the population isn't large?
- Then we'd still use the prior z-statistic but it would follow a t-distribution with the degrees of freedom, v estimated from the data:

`$$v = \frac{(\frac{s_x^2}{m}+\frac{S_y^2}{n})^2}{\frac{(\frac{s_x^2}{m})^2}{m-1}+\frac{(\frac{s_y^2}{n})^2}{n-1}}$$`

- In R, we can just define a function to do the computing for us and just be careful with the parentheses:

```r
v_dft_est &lt;- function(s1,s2,m,n){
  ((s1^2/m) + (s2^2/n))^2/(((s1^2/m)^2/(m-1)) + ((s2^2/n)^2/(n-1)))
}
```
- V indicates Welch's estimate

- The confidence interval of the two sample t: `\(100(1-a)%\)` confidence interval for `\(\mu_1 - \mu_2\)` is given by:
`$$\bar{X} - \bar{Y} \pm t_{a/2,v}\sqrt{\frac{s_x^2}{m} + \frac{s_y^2}{n}}$$`
- using the above value of v.

---
# What if we have no sigma?
- If we have no `\(\sigma\)`, we can use the t-statistic which is computed as folows:
`$$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \bar{y} - \delta_0}{\sqrt{\frac{s_x^2}{m} + \frac{s_y^2}{n}}}$$`
- and use the typical rejection criterion for 1 and 2 tailed tests

- In R:

```r
tstat2 &lt;- function(xbar,ybar,delta,s1,s2,m,n){
  (xbar - ybar - delta)/(sqrt((s1^2/m) + (s2^2)/n))
  }
```

# An Example:
Example 1
Example 1: Suppose that talk-time per battery charge on an iPhone 6s 
is normally distributed with unknown mean u1 and known standard deviation sigma1 = .7. Likewise, talk-time per battery charge on an iPhone 6c is normally distributed with unknown mean u2 and known standard deviation sigma2 = .9. A random sample of m=81 6s yielded a mean talking time of 7.2 hours, while a random sample of 70 6c's yielded a mean talking time of 6.8 hours. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for u1 - u2.

---
# Example worked out:
- We can identify the following from the problem:


```r
# information about the iphone 6s
sd1 &lt;- .7
# information about the iphone 6c
sd2 &lt;- .9
#sample of iphone 6s
m1s &lt;- 81
mu1s &lt;- 7.2
#sample of iphone 6c
n1c &lt;- 70
mu2c &lt;- 6.8
zstar &lt;- qnorm(1- .05/2)
zstar
```

```
## [1] 1.959964
```

---
# Example continued:


```r
z2confint(mu1s,mu2c,zstar = zstar,sigma1 = sd1,sigma2 =sd2 ,m = m1s,n = n1c)
```

```
## $lower_bound
## [1] 0.1213444
## 
## $upper_bound
## [1] 0.6786556
```
If you ever need to see the arguments of a user defined function, just omit the parentheses

```r
z2confint
```

```
## function(xbar,ybar,zstar,sigma1,sigma2,m,n){
##   list(lower_bound = xbar - ybar - zstar * (sqrt((sigma1/m) + (sigma2^2/n))),
##        upper_bound = xbar - ybar + zstar * (sqrt((sigma1/m) + (sigma2^2/n))))
## }
```

# Example 2:
A Student wanted to analyze whether there is a difference in average salaries of men and women performing the same task in the same environment. A random sample of 100 men yielded an average salary of \$36,240 with a standard deviation of  1,000. A random sample of 81 women yielded an average salary of  $35,930 with a standard deviation of \$1200. Test for higher male salaries at the 5% level.

# Example 2 worked out:

```r
# what we know about the problem
xbar &lt;- 36240
sd1 &lt;- 1000
ybar &lt;- 35930
sd2 &lt;- 1200
m &lt;- 100
n &lt;- 81

(df &lt;- v_dft_est(s1=  sd1,s2 = sd2,m = m,n = n))
```

```

```

```r
(tstat &lt;- tstat2(xbar,ybar,delta = 0,sd1,sd2,m,n))

# When we want to compare two population proportions
- Let's assume we had two population proportions. Assume `\(p_1\)` is the proportion of successes in population 1. We then take a random sample of size m from population 1 and obtain X successes so that `\(\hat{p} = \frac{X}{M}\)` and X has a binomial distribution `\(Bin(m,p_2)\)`. Suppose `\(p_2\)` is the proportion of successes in population 2. We take a sample of size n from population 2 and obtain y successes such that `\(\hat{p_2} = \frac{Y}{n}\)` and y has a binomial distribution `\(Bin(m,p_1)\)`. Assuming independence, then:

`$$E(\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2})= p_1 - p_2$$` 
and
`$$V(\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2}) = \frac{p_1(1 - p_1)}{m} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n}$$`
thus;
`$$Z = \frac{\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2} - (p_1 - p_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{m} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n}}}$$`
has an approximately normal distribution.

---
# Confidence Intervals for two population proportions:

- a large sample 100(1-a)% confidence interval for `\(p_1 - p_2\)` is then

`$$\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2} \pm z_{a/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p_1}(1 - \hat {p_1})}{m} + \frac{\hat{p_2}(1 - \hat {p_2})}{m}}$$`

---
# Example:
From the 2010 General Social Survey 475 out of 631 randomly selected males favor the death penalty compared to 424 out of 677 females. Find a 95% confidence interval for the true difference in proportions, (male -female).


```r
m &lt;- 631
n &lt;- 677
X &lt;- 475
Y &lt;- 424
phat1 &lt;- X/m
phat2 &lt;- Y/n
sediffest &lt;- sqrt((phat1 * (1-phat1))/m + (phat2 * (1 - phat2))/n)
zstar &lt;- qnorm(1-.05/2)
c(phat1 - phat2 - zstar * sediffest,phat1 - phat2 + zstar * sediffest)
```
