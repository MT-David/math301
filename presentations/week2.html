# Introduction to Probability
### Sebastian Hoyos-Torres

### Outline:
- In this section, we will cover the following:
  - Sample Spaces and Events
  - Properties, Axioms and Interpretations of Probability
  - Definitions of Probability
  - Equally likely probability spaces and counting techniques
  - Conditional Probability
  - Independence
---

### The Uncertain World
- Often, we are faced with questions of uncertainty. For example;
  - How likely is it that you win the powerball?
  - If you intend to have children until you have at least one child of each sex then how many children will you have on average?
  - How many traffic lights will be red on your trip to the store?

---

### Key Terms before diving in
- **Experiment**: any action or process where the outcome is subject to uncertainty.
- **Sample Space**: Set of all possible outcomes of an **experiment**.
  - **Note**: Size of the set is NOT the sample space 
- **Event**: any subset of a sample space.
- **Simple Event**: event consisting of a single outcome.
- **Compound Event**: Consists of more than one outcome.
- **Probability Function**: gives the probability for each outcome within the sample space.
---

##Some useful notation to keep in mind in this section

- `\(\Omega\)` : indicates the sample space. Also can be denoted as S or U

- `\(\in\)` :Indicates that an element is a member of a set (e.g `\(a \in \Omega\)`)

- `\(\emptyset\)`: Indicates the empty set in set theory. In probability, it is known as the empty event. Also known as the **impossible event** 

- `\(\cup\)`: Indicates a union between elements. For example `\(A \cup B\)` reads as "A or B"

- `\(\cap\)` Indicates an intersection between elements. For example `\(A \cap B\)` reads as "A and B"

- `\(A^C\)`: Indicates a compement.In this case it would indicate "the elements not in A"

- `\(|\)` : Reads as "Given"
---

### Examples
- To understand the definitons better, let's see a few examples

- Tossing a coin. Within a coin flip, there are 2 possible outcomes. The **sample space ** in this example is {H,T}. In this case a *simple event* will be {H}.
  - This changes when you toss a coin twice. Instead of {H,T}, now you can have {0,1,2} corresponding to the number of heads appearing. Another is {HH,HT,TH,TH} corresponding to the first, second toss. In this sample space, the event of getting one heads can be represented by {HT,TH} 

- Let Y mean you scored in the 85th percentile and N mean you did not. The sample space in this case would be an infinite discrete on with {Y,NY,NNY,...}
  - However, the even you do not take the GRE more than 3 times would look like {Y,NY,NNY}
---

### Examples: Cont
- Consider choosing a random strand of hair from the interval `\(S = (0,100)\)` . What would be some possible events?
  - In this example, which is infinite and continuous, we could say some possible events are `\(A = {{x|0 \le x \le 1}}\)` which is a **compound event** or `\(B = {10.55}\)` which is a simple event.

- **Important**: Sample Spaces can be finite and discrete, infinite and discrete, or infinite and continuous.

### Using some of the language of Set Theory examples

- Assume we have a randomly select a student to see how many shirts they
