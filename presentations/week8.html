# What we will cover in this lecture:
- A brief review of point estimates.

- Properties of the sample mean and sample sum of iid random variables.

- Definition and basic properties of confidence intervals

- Normal confidence intervals with known standard deviation.

- Large sample confidence intervals with unknown standard deviation.

- T- distribution and confidence intervals.

---
# Point Estimates:
- What is a point estimate?

--
  - A point estimate is simply an estimate of a population parameter which is calculated from a sample.
  
  - Examples of point estimates include the sample mean or a proportion

- Estimators: the estimator is the random variable whose value will always be a point estimate. 

---
# Random samples
- Evaluating the distribution of a statistic calculated from a sample with an arbitrary joint distribution is usually very difficult.

- Often, assumptions are made that our data constitute a random sample from a distribution. This means that 
  - All `\(X_i\)`'s are independent. 
  - All `\(X_i\)`'s have the same probability distribution.

---
# Properties of Sample Mean and Sample Sum
- Remember, if `\(X_1,...,X_n\)` is a random sample from a distribution with mean value `\(\mu\)` and standard deviation `\(\theta\)` then:
  - `\(E(X) = \mu_{\bar{X}}\)`
  - `\(V(X) = \sigma^2_x = \sigma^2/n\)`

- Let `\(T_n = X_1,+X_2+,...,+X_n\)` be the sample total; then 
  - `\(E(T) = n\mu\)`
  - `\(V(T_n) = n\sigma^2\)`

- **If the Original Distribution of the `\(X_i\)`'s is normal, then the distribution of `\(\bar{X}\)` and `\(T_n\)` is also normal**

---
# Why Statisicians are Probably Right: Confidence Intervals
- When we speak of confidence intervals, what do we mean?

- The formal definition: suppose `\(x_1,x_2,...,x_n\)` is a random sample from a normal population with mean `\(\mu\)` and know standard deviation `\(\sigma\)`. Then :
`$$Z = \frac{(\bar{X} - \mu)}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$$`
has a standard normal distribution. If we define `\(z_a\)` as the 1-a quantile of a standard normal distribution z~N(0,1) so that `\(P(Z&gt;z_a) = \alpha\)`, then we can manipulate A as follows for any a &lt; 0.5.
`$$1 - a = P(-z_{a/2}\leq{Z}\leq{z_{a/2}})$$`
`$$P(\bar{X} - z_{a/2}*\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\leq{\mu}\leq{\bar{X}+ z_{a/2}*\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}})$$`
the `\(z_{a/2}\)`'s are sometimes referred to as critical values.

# Confidence Intervals in R
- Example borrowed from Penn State:
A random sample of 126 police officers subjected to constant inhalation of automobile exhaust fumes in downtown Cairo had an average blood lead level concentration of 29.2 μg/dl. Assume X, the blood lead level of a randomly selected policeman, is normally distributed with a standard deviation of σ = 7.5 μg/dl. Historically, it is known that the average blood lead level concentration of humans with no exposure to automobile exhaust is 18.2 μg/dl. Is there convincing evidence that policemen exposed to constant auto exhaust have elevated blood lead level concentrations? (Data source: Kamal, Eldamaty, and Faris, "Blood lead level of Cairo traffic policemen," Science of the Total Environment, 105(1991): 165-170.)

- How do we incorporate what we've talked about so far into R?
---
# Confidence Intervals in R continued:
- Lets look at the formula to calculate the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval. Namely; these parts
`$$\bar{X}+z_{a/2}*\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$`
`$$\bar{X}-z_{a/2}*\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$`
keeping this in mind, let's just create our own function to compute a confidence interval in R.

```r
confint &lt;- function(xbar, zstar, sigma, n) {
    list(upper_bound = xbar + zstar * (sigma/sqrt(n)), lower_bound = xbar - 
        zstar * (sigma/sqrt(n)))
}
```
With this function, let's now just work on plugging things in.
---
# Confidence Interval in R continued:

- Now that we have defined our function in R, doing the computation for the confidence interval gets pretty simple.

- First, let's look at the necessary components:
  - we have a sample of n = 126
  - `\(\bar{X}\)` or the sample mean is 29.2
  - the standard deviation or `\(\sigma\)` = 7.5


```r
zstar &lt;- qnorm(1 - (0.05/2))
confint(29.2, zstar, 7.5, 126)
```

```
## $upper_bound
## [1] 30.50956
## 
## $lower_bound
## [1] 27.89044
```

---
# What does this mean?
- A lot of well meaning people make the error of saying that the probability that the true mean is between the upper and lower bounds is equivalent to 1-a.
So what does a confidence interval really mean? And why is this statement wrong?

--
  - A confidence interval indicates that we'd expect 1-a of the intervals to be correct and to contain the unknown value `\(\mu\)`. Since we'll almost never know the true population mean, we settle for intervals and say we are 95 percent confident that 95 percent of the intervals generated would be correct.
  - In practice, we often take 1 random sample from the population so all we can really say is that we are confident that the population mean lies in the interval we generated.
---
--- 
# A Simulation:
- Simulations are useful to illustrate the notion of confidence intervals so let's try our hand at simulating to see exactly what a confidence interval contains. 

- Let's create 100 95 percent confidence intervals from a sample of size 35. The true population mean in our case be 25, with a standard deviation of 4.

---
# Simulation in R
- The simulation of the confidence interval.

```r
counter &lt;- 0
qnorm(1 - (0.05/2))
```

```
## [1] 1.959964
```

```r
for (i in 1:1000) {
    x &lt;- rnorm(35, 25, 4)
    conf &lt;- confint(mean(x), 1.96, 4, 30)
    if (conf$lower_bound &lt; 25 &amp;&amp; conf$upper_bound &gt; 25) {
        counter &lt;- counter + 1
    }
}
counter/1000
```

```
## [1] 0.967
```
- As the above code illustrates approximately 96.7% of the intervals we generate will have the true population mean within it (which is pretty close to the 95 percent confidence).

---
# Some Things to Note from Our Simulations:

- Notice that when `\(\sigma\)` is known, the length of our 100*(1-a)% confidence interval only depends on n and is `\(2\dot{}z_{a/2}\dot{}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\)`. If we want the interval to have length w, just solve:

`$$w = 2 \dot{}z_{a/2}\dot{}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$`

for n giving `\(n\geq{(2\dot{}z_{a/2}\dot{}\frac{\sigma}{w})^2}\)`

---
# Example:
How large of a sample do we need to guarantee that the length of the automobile mpg 99 percent confidence interval = 2 and if the standard deviation = 3.5?

```r
w &lt;- 2
zstar &lt;- qnorm(1 - 0.01/2)
### creating our function from the formula
widthfunct &lt;- function(zstar, sigma, w) {
    (2 * zstar * sigma/w)^2
}
(n &lt;- widthfunct(zstar, sigma = 3.5, w))
```

# What if we don't know the Population Parameters:

- Very rarely are you going to have information about the population parameters.

- For example, the prior examples have relied on having the population standard deviation, `\(\sigma\)`. What happens when we don't have sigma?

--

- We simply use the point estimators which are appropriate for the parameters of interest. In the population standard deviation case; the answer would simply be the sample standard deviation `\(s\)`

- Further, the law of large numbers says that as a sample size gets larger, each of the above estimates tend to get closer to the real parameter.

---
# Confidence Intervals continued:

- If the population is normal and the sample size is large, ($\geq{30}$) with mean `\(\mu\)` then:

`$$T = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}$$`
has approximately a standard normal distribution and:

`$$\bar{X} - z_{a/2}\dot{}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}},\bar{X} + z_{a/2}\dot{}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$`
is a confidence interval for `\(\mu\)`
---
# Example:
A random sample of 120 lightening flashes resulted in an average radar echo duration of .83 seconds with a sample standard deviation of .4 seconds. Calculate a 99 percent confidence interval for the true average echo duration.

```r
n &lt;- 120
xbar &lt;- 0.83
s &lt;- 0.4
alpha &lt;- 1 - 0.99
zstar &lt;- qnorm(1 - alpha/2)
confint(xbar, zstar, s, n)  # the only thing that changed in the formula was sigma got replaced with s so we can still use the same formula
```

```
## $upper_bound
## [1] 0.924056
## 
## $lower_bound
## [1] 0.735944
```
---
# Prove that sample size matters!
- Sure, all it takes is to use a for loop and a simulation. With 1000 simulations, things should be ok. Let's take some random samples from the normal distribution of n = 4 and the population mean and standard deviation are 25 and 4 respectively.

```r
counter &lt;- 0
for (i in seq(1:1000)) {
    x &lt;- rnorm(4, 25, 4)
    conf &lt;- confint(mean(x), qnorm(1 - 0.05/2), sd(x), 4)
    if (conf$lower_bound &lt; 25 &amp;&amp; 25 &lt; conf$upper_bound) {
        counter &lt;- counter + 1
    }
}
counter/1000
```

```
## [1] 0.848
```
From our simulation, we see that if we have a small sample, our confidence interval is far from the confidence interval we wanted to generate. In this case only 84.8% of the intervals contained the true mean.

---
# T distributions:
- If the population is normal and `\(\sigma\)` and `\(\mu\)` are unknown, then 
`$$T = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}$$`
has a t distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom. Also:
`$$[\bar{X} - t_{a/2,n-1}\dot{}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}},\bar{X} + t_{a/2,n-1}\dot{}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}]$$`
is the 100(1-a) percent confidence interval for `\(\mu\)`. If R is available (It always will be available as long as you have a computer), then `\(t_{a/2,n-1}\)` can be calculated with the function qt and adjusting the appropriate arguments. 
---
# Example of using T:
- Taking the lightening rod problem as before and adjusting it so that we can't use normal approximations, lets see how to apply t

A random sample of 20 lightening flashes resulted in an average radar echo duration of .83 seconds with a sample standard deviation of .4 seconds. Calculate a 99 percent confidence interval for the true average echo duration.

```r
n &lt;- 20
xbar &lt;- 0.83
s &lt;- 0.4
alpha &lt;- 1 - 0.99
tstar &lt;- qt(1 - alpha/2, n - 1)
confint(xbar, tstar, s, n)  # although the formula changes, we can still use the confint function we defined a while back
```

# Confidence intervals for Bernoulli Trials
- If we have a sequence of n bernoulli trials with probability of succcess p, then if n is large enough (and p is not near 0 or 1).
`$$\frac{(\hat{p}-p)}{\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}}$$`
has approximately a standard normal distribution. If we approximate p by `\(\hat{p}\)` in the denominator, than an appropriate confidence interval for p is:
`$$\hat{p}- z_{a/2}\dot{}\frac{\sqrt{\hat{p}\dot{}(1-p)}}{\sqrt{n}},\hat{p}+ z_{a/2}\dot{}\frac{\sqrt{\hat{p}\dot{}(1-p)}}{\sqrt{n}}$$`
Large sample recommendations are np and n(1-p) where both are greater than 10 or both the number of successes and failures in the sample are at least 15 for successes and failures

---
--- 
# Example:
The national sexual pattern survey found that 173 out of 2673 adult heterosexuals had multiple partners. Give a 95 percent classical confidence interval for the true proportion of heterosexuals with multiple partners.

```r
n &lt;- 2673
x &lt;- 173
phat &lt;- x/n
alpha &lt;- 1 - 0.95
zstar &lt;- qnorm(1 - alpha/2)
# Defining our own function
bconf &lt;- function(phat, zstar, n) {
    list(upper_bound = phat + zstar * sqrt(phat * (1 - phat))/sqrt(n), lower_bound = phat - 
        zstar * sqrt(phat * (1 - phat))/sqrt(n))
}
bconf(phat, zstar, n)
```

# Confidence Intervals: Scores for p
In the bernoulli trial situation, if we start with 
`$$P[-z_{a/2}\leq{\frac{\hat{p} - p}{\sqrt{\frac{p*(1-p)}{n}}}}\leq{z_{a/2}}]$$`
is approximately 1-a since the center of the expression is approximately standard normal and then solve for both:

`$$\frac{\hat{p} - p}{\sqrt{\frac{p*(1-p)}{n}}} = -z_{a/2}$$` 
`$$\frac{\hat{p} - p}{\sqrt{\frac{p*(1-p)}{n}}} = z_{a/2}$$`

---
# Score confidence Interval:
- the resulting solutions form the following interval: let z-star = `\(z_{a/2}\)`. Then the (1-a)% confidence interval is:
`$$-\frac{1}{2} * \frac{-zstar^2 - 2n\hat{p} + \sqrt{zstar^4+ 4zstar^2np - 4n\hat{p}^2zstar^2}}{zstar^2 + n}$$`
`$$\frac{1}{2} * \frac{zstar^2 + 2n\hat{p} + \sqrt{zstar^4+ 4zstar^2np - 4n\hat{p}^2zstar^2}}{zstar^2 + n}$$`

- The above is known as the score confidence interval for p

---
# One sided confidence bounds:
Suppose `\(x_1,...,x_n\)` is a random sample from a normal population with mean `\(\mu\)` and known standard deviation `\(\sigma\)` Then:
`$$Z = \frac{(\bar{X} - \mu)}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$$`
has a standard normal distribution. If we define `\(z_a\)` as the 1-a quantile of a N(0,1) distribution so that `\(P(Z&gt;z_a) = a\)` then we can manipulate a as follows for any `\(a &lt; 0.5\)`
`$$1- a = P(Z\leq{z_a}) = P(\mu\leq{\bar{X} + z_a*\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$$`

---
# Prediction intervals:
Confidence Intervals and confidence bounds estimate the mean value of the distribution under consideration. If we want a confidence interval for a future single observation then we must take into account the error for estimating the mean and the error for a single observation. This results in a prediction interval.
`$$\bar{X}-t_{a/2,n-1}*s\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{n}},\bar{X}+t_{a/2,n-1}*s\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{n}}$$`

---
# Prediction Interval Example:
A random sample of 20 lightening flashes resulted in an average radar echo duration of .83 seconds with a sample standard deviation of .4 seconds. Calculate a 90 percent prediction interval for the echo duration of the next measurement.


```r
n &lt;- 20
xbar &lt;- 0.83
s &lt;- 0.4
alpha &lt;- 1 - 0.9
tstar &lt;- qt(1 - alpha/2, n - 1)
predint &lt;- function(xbar, tstar, s, n) {
    list(upper_bound = xbar + tstar * s * sqrt(1 + 1/n), lower_bound = xbar - 
        tstar * s * sqrt(1 + 1/n))
}
predint(xbar, tstar, s, n)
